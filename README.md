## Secure Patient Data Management on Public Blockchain with Private Nodes (POC)

**Project Overview**

This repository documents a Proof of Concept (POC) exploring the feasibility of using private nodes on a public blockchain, along with OpSec technology, for secure and privacy-preserving patient data management in healthcare.

**Objective**

The primary objective is to evaluate the effectiveness of this approach in achieving:

* Enhanced security for sensitive patient data
* Improved patient privacy control
* Streamlined data sharing between authorized healthcare providers
* Transparent and auditable data management processes

**Technology Stack**

* **Public Blockchain:** (to be determined - Hyperledger Fabric or Ethereum with Consortium Mode)
* **Private Nodes:** Operated by authorized healthcare organizations within the consortium network.
* **OpSec Technology:** Leverages AI-powered security features for threat detection, vulnerability management, and potential secure enclave utilization.
* **Encryption:** Industry-standard encryption (e.g., AES-256) for data at rest and in transit.
* **Smart Contracts:** Govern patient consent, data access control, and audit trails.

**Scenario**

The POC focuses on a healthcare setting (e.g., hospital) and demonstrates functionalities for:

1. **Patient Registration:** Secure storage of encrypted basic demographic data and patient consent management.
2. **Medical Records Creation:** Secure storage of anonymized and encrypted EMR data with access control based on healthcare professional roles.
3. **Data Sharing:** Secure and permissioned sharing of specific data points with authorized providers upon patient consent.
4. **Immutable Audit Trail:** Recording all data interactions on the blockchain ledger for transparency and compliance.

**POC Activities**

1. **Network Setup and Security:** Deploying the blockchain network with private nodes, OpSec integration, and security testing.
2. **Smart Contract Development:** Implementing smart contracts for data management functionalities.
3. **Data Management and Security:** Developing functionalities for secure data encryption, anonymization, and key management.
4. **User Interface Prototyping:** Building a basic prototype interface for healthcare professionals to interact with the system.

**Evaluation Criteria**

* **Security:** Effectiveness of OpSec integration and overall security posture.
* **Performance:** Scalability and transaction processing times for real-world healthcare data volumes.
* **Usability:** User-friendliness of the prototype interface for healthcare professionals.
* **Compliance:** Alignment with relevant healthcare data privacy regulations (e.g., HIPAA).

**Benefits**

* Stronger security for patient data through private nodes and OpSec technology.
* Increased patient control over data through consent management.
* Efficient and secure data sharing between authorized healthcare providers.
* Transparent and auditable data management processes for regulatory compliance.

**Limitations**

* Technical complexity of setting up and maintaining a private blockchain network.
* Scalability challenges of public blockchains with consortium mode for high data volumes.
* Evolving regulatory landscape surrounding blockchain use in healthcare.

**Next Steps**

Based on the POC results, further development could involve:

* Expanding functionalities for managing different healthcare data types.
* Integrating the system with existing healthcare information systems.
* Pilot testing with a broader group of users.
* Addressing regulatory considerations for wider adoption.

**Getting Started**

This repository is currently under development for the POC. Further technical details and code will be added as the project progresses.
